Dear ${NAME_PLACEHOLDER},

Your request to create a new room in Jeopardye has just been approved!

Please visit ${APP_BASE}?req=${REQUEST_ID_PLACEHOLDER} and click "Create New Room" to create your room.
If you have never played Jeopardye before, you will have to create a player before you can create a room.

Once you have created your room, you can send the room code or a link to the room to your friends, and they can join your room and play with you.

Have fun playing trivia with your friends!

Best,
Jeopardye Bot
